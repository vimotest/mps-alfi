# Compitest Car Example

This folder contains PDF dumps of the MPS models of the Car example from the MPS ALFI project.
The PDFs are a dump of the projectional editor using Editor2Pdf (https://github.com/Fumapps/Editor2PDF).

In ALF, there is a package `Cars` with classes `Vehicle`, `Car`, and an interface `IHasColor`.
They demonstrate structural modeling including inheritance.

The example visualizes how a simple ALF-based model is represented in Java and C++.
