- [ ] 10.5 Features

## Standard Model Library (11)

The features of the standard model library will not be implemented in the language definition of alfi.
Rather, it will be implemented as a model written with/in alfi.
All elements marked as primitive must be mapped to some actual implementation
When running generated Alf code, the implementation will be provided by the Alf implementation.
For target languages, a mapping from these elements to suitable elements in the target language must be defined.

- [x] 11.1 Overview (no implementation needed)
- [x] 11.2 ~~ActionLanguage Profile~~ (not implemented in alfi as alfi is not a UML tool)
- [x] 11.3 Primitive Types
- [x] 11.4 Primitive Behaviors
  - Only the `ToString` methods
- [x] 11.5 Basic Input and Output
  - Only `ReadLine` and `WriteLine` and without `errorStatus` parameter
- [ ] 11.6 Collection Functions
- [ ] 11.7 Collection Classes
